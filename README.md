# remind-me

## Description

Remind Me is a simple reminder app. A user is able to type in something they want to remember, give it a title, and save it to their browser's localStorage.
- The floppy icon saves a note
- The plus icon clears the fields to make way for a new note
- The trash icon clears local storage should the user want a clean slate




## Features
- The app at the root is a fully functioning app.
- The _debug_with_comments folder is the same application with bugs, but the bugs are documented with potential solutions
- The _debug_with_no_comments folder is the same application with bugs, but without any suggestions or comments
